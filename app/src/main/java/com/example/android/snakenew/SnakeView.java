/**
 * Created by Ruiqi Li on 2017/12/10.
 *
 * This is a customised view aiming to draw every elements on the screen for the game Snake.
 * Player can control the direction of this virtual snake (green bar in the pictures) by just tapping
 * on the screen. When the snake eat(touch) the food (green stroke square), it will become longer
 * and keep moving. The food will disappear after eaten by the snake and appear randomly around the
 * screen immediately. The speed is increased every successful eaten and the lose condition is
 * touching the wall or "eat" (touch) snake itself. In the whole game mode, once the player have
 * eaten 4 consecutive foods, the exit door (white stroke square) will appear on the center of the
 * screen and the player can leave and enter the next mini game.
